# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
  My application will be an all in one recipe book and meal planner app. Users will find this useful whether they are a hardworking parent, a busy career person, or even just someone who wants to begin cooking for themselves but aren't sure where to start. Whhen choosing your meals, you can browse through recipes submitted by other users, or even submit your own. Once you've chosen your meals for the week, the program will generate a grocery list for you, saving you valuable time and effort. Users can check off any items they already own, and then head to the grocery store with a list of any other ingredients they still need!
  I thought of this idea because I, personally, find myself too busy to plan out meals ahead of time. Once I do have enough time to cook, I usually do not have the ingredients I would want in my kitchen. My roommate and I tend to take grocery trips without a plan in mind, and then even with a full refridgerator, cannot think of anything to cook. We have trouble coming up with new meal ideas, make the same thing too often, or end up ordering out. This app could be useful to anyone like myself, and also encourage a healthier lifestyle even if you have felt to busy in the past. It would also save on food costs, cut down on stress, and even teach you how to cook.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to research API's to see if that is something I will want to use in my project. I will need to learn more about user authentication, and possibly how to smoothly transition recipes to a quick view for the user.
