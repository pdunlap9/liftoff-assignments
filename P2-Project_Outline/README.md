# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
  Are you like me, and find yourself too busy to plan out meals ahead of time? My application will be an all in one recipe book and meal planner app. When choosing your meals, you can browse through recipes submitted by other users, or even submit your own. Once you've chosen your meals for the week, the program will generate a grocery list for you, saving you valuable time and effort.
  
### Features
Login - users will be able to log into their own accounts, this will enable them to build their plans and see favorited recipes.

Build plan - Users can choose from a list of recipes for their week, designate which meal, and favorite them.

Submit recipes - Users will be able to type out or copy paste their favorite recipes with different sections for ingredients, instructions, descriptions, and even a picture if preferred.

Search - users can search for recipes using certain ingredients using key words.

Generate List - Once their plan is created, users can create a checklist of ingredients, with the option to mark them off if they already own them.

### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to research API's to see if that is something I will want to use in my project. I will need to learn more about user authentication, and possibly how to smoothly transition recipes to a quick view for the user.
